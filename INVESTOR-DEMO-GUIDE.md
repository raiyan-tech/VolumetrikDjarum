## 🎪 Demo Scripts

### Opening Line
"I'd like to show you something that's only become possible in the last few years - streaming volumetric video to mobile devices with augmented reality."

### Desktop Demo Script
"What you're seeing here is a true 3D capture of a performer - not CGI, not a photogrammetry model, but actual volumetric video. Notice how you can rotate around and see every angle. This is streaming live from the cloud, progressively loading a 3GB file, but playback started almost immediately."

### Mobile Demo Script
"Now let me show you the same experience on mobile. The interface adapts automatically - all touch-optimized. This is the same webapp, no separate mobile app needed. Just share a link and anyone can view it."

### AR Demo Script ⭐
"Here's where it gets interesting. Watch what happens when I tap 'View in AR'...

*Camera opens*

See that circle on the floor? That's the system understanding the real-world environment. Now I tap to place the performer...

*Tap to place*

And now she's standing right here in this room. I can walk around her, view from any angle, in real space. This is WebXR - web-based augmented reality. No app download, no special software, just a browser.

Imagine this for:
- A virtual concert in your living room
- Trying furniture in AR before buying
- A fitness trainer demonstrating exercises
- A museum exhibit you can walk around at home"

## 🎯 Addressing Common Questions

### "How is this different from regular video?"
"Regular video is flat - 2D. This is true 3D - you can view from any angle, place it in real space with AR. It's the difference between watching someone on a screen vs having them in the room."

### "What devices does it work on?"
"Desktop: Any modern browser. Mobile: iOS and Android. AR: Android phones with ARCore - that's most Samsung, Google Pixel, OnePlus, etc. iOS AR support coming via USDZ format."

### "How do you capture volumetric video?"
"We use 4DView technology - a multi-camera rig that captures performers from all angles simultaneously. The system processes this into a streamable 4DS format."

### "What's the business model?"
"We see several revenue streams:
- B2B: License to entertainment companies, e-commerce platforms
- B2C: Direct-to-consumer performances, events
- SaaS: Platform hosting fees
- Production: Volumetric capture services"

### "What's the market size?"
"The volumetric video market is projected to reach $15B by 2030. Early adopters include:
- Live entertainment (concerts, sports)
- E-commerce (virtual try-on)
- Education and training
- Gaming and social media"

### "Who are your competitors?"
"Volumetric video: 8i, Volograms, Microsoft Mixed Reality Capture. But we're focused on mobile-first streaming, not production tools. Our advantage is accessibility - no app required, works on existing devices."

### "What's next?"
"Our roadmap includes:
- Real-time volumetric streaming (reduce latency)
- Interactive experiences (user can trigger actions)
- Multi-performer scenes
- Integration with commerce platforms
- Lower bandwidth requirements (5G optimization)"

## 🎨 Visual Aids (Optional)

Consider preparing:
1. **Slide deck** with use cases
2. **Screen recording** as backup
3. **Comparison video** (2D vs 3D)
4. **Market size charts**
5. **Revenue projections**

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting During Demo

### If AR doesn't work:
"AR requires an Android phone with ARCore support. Let me show you the desktop and mobile version instead, which work on all devices."

### If loading is slow:
"This is a 3GB file streaming over WiFi. In production, we optimize for 4G/5G speeds. Let me switch to a smaller demo file."

### If video won't play:
"Let me reload - sometimes browser cache needs clearing. While it loads, let me walk through the use cases..."

*Have backup screen recording ready!*
